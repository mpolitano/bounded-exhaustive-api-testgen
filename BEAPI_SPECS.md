# Analysis of Specifications using `BEAPI` (RQ3 in Section 4.3 of the paper)

In this section, we analize the `repOKs` provided with the benchmarks, with the help of `BEAPI`.

## Running a single experiment to find mismatching between repOK and the API.


First, move to the scripts folder.


```
cd script
```

To evaluate if the set of structures generated by  `BEAPI` is included in the set of structures generated by `Korat` run the following script:

```
./run-inclusion-beapi-in-korat.sh <benchmark> <case study> <beapi scope> <korat scope> 
```




To evaluate if the set of structures generated by  `Korat` is included in the set of structures generated by `BEAPI` run the following script:

```
./run-inclusion-korat-in-beapi.sh <benchmark> <case study> <korat scope> <beapi scope>  
```


In these above scripts,  `<benchmark>` is one of `0_korat`, `1_kiasan`, `2_roops`, `3_fajita`; `<case study>` is one of the case studies of `<benchmark>` listed in the subsection below; `<beapi scope>` is the scope used to generate inputs with `BEAPI`; and `<korat scope>` is the scope used by `Korat` to generate inputs from `repOK`.


For simplicity from now on, we will refer to the set of inputs generated with beapi as `APISet`, and the set of structures generated by `Korat` as `RepOKSet`.






In this case we will be evaluating if the valid structures (generated from `repOK`) are a subset of structures generated from the API,  and those API generated structures that are not valid according to `repOk` (if any), will be pointing out  `repOK` errors, which must be manually confirmed.






For example, to check `BEAPI` inclusion in `Korat` for `RedBlackTree` from the `0_korat` benchmark, execute: 


```
./run-inclusion-beapi-in-korat.sh 2_roops ncl.NodeCachingLinkedList 3 3
```

At the end of its execution the script shows a summary of the results in CSV format:

```
************
Report
Project,Class,Technique,Budget,Other Bdgt,Structures,Other Strs,Not Included,Not Incl %
0_korat,korat.examples.redblacktree.RedBlackTree,beapi/matching/builders,3,3,11,16,0,0
************
```


By other hand, to check `Korat` inclusion in `BEAPI` from the `0_korat` benchmark, execute:

```
./run-inclusion-korat-in-beapi.sh 0_korat korat.examples.redblacktree.RedBlackTree 3 3
```

At the end of its execution the script shows a summary of the results in CSV format:

```
************
Report
Project,Class,Technique,Budget,Other Bdgt,Structures,Other Strs,Not Included,Not Incl %
0_korat,korat.examples.redblacktree.RedBlackTree,korat,3,3,16,11,5,31.2
************
```

where:

- **Project**: the name of the selected benchmark.
- **Class**: the name of the case study.
- **Technique**: the generation technique that we want to evaluate if it is included in a second technique (**Other**)
- **Budget**: the scope (maximum number of nodes, integers, etc...) used for the first **Technique** generation.
- **Other Bdgt**: the scope (maximum number of nodes, integers, etc...) used for the **Other** technique  generation.
- **Structures**: the number of structures generated by the first technique  
- **Other Strs**: the number of structures generated by the  **second** technique
- **Not Included**: the number of structures generated by the first technique that were not generated by the second technique 
- **Not Incl %**: the percentage of structures generated by the first technique that were not generated by the second technique



As can be seen, observing both reports above,  all structures generated by `BEAPI` (11) are incluided in the structures generated by `Korat` (16). In other words, 0 `BEAPI` structures are **Not Included** in `Korat's` generated structures. Also, as you can note, `Korat` generate 5 more structures than `BEAPI`. 

By the other hand, obseerving the second report, 



In **Table 3** of **Section 4.3** of the paper can be seen the `repOK` error (underspecification) reported for this case. By inspection of `repOk` source code (`0_korat/src/main/java/korat/examples/redblacktree/RedBlackTree.java`) you can see the reported bug.



A log of the output of running inclusion is saved in several files:













As another example, running the following scripts: 

```
./run-inclusion-beapi-in-korat.sh 0_korat korat.examples.singlylinkedlist.SinglyLinkedList  3 3
./run-inclusion-korat-in-beapi.sh 0_korat korat.examples.singlylinkedlist.SinglyLinkedList  3 3
```


EXPLICAR QUE SON IGUALES


Notice that **Table 3** of **Section 4.3** of the paper reports only the errors found in `repOK` that are part of the case studies of each benchmark. In this table the **Error Description** column shows a brief description of the error found in `repOK`, which was manually identified. All `repOK` errors reported on table previously mentioned, can be found in the corresponding `java` source file located at `<benchmark>/src/main/java/<case study>` for each `<benchmark>` and `<case study>`.
